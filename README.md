## Command Blocker Legacy
In order to properly install this plugin on Spigot servers that run lower than 1.8.8, you must also install the
module called Command Blocker Legacy, available [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/command-blocker-legacy.82948/).
It includes libraries which are missing from those versions of the game, such as [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson).
